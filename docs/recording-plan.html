<pre><code>INTRODUCTION:
[Start with platform logo/splash screen]

&quot;Welcome to The Give Hub, our innovative crowdfunding platform designed to connect passionate creators with generous supporters. In this demonstration, we&#39;ll walk through the complete user journey from registration to donation, as well as the powerful administrative tools that ensure platform quality and integrity. Let&#39;s get started.&quot;

USER REGISTRATION:
[Navigate to homepage]

&quot;Here&#39;s our welcoming homepage that introduces new users to The Give Hub. To join the platform, a new user simply clicks the &#39;Sign Up&#39; button at the top right corner.&quot;

[Click Sign Up]

&quot;Our registration process is straightforward and user-friendly. First, we&#39;ll enter basic account information including email, username, and a secure password. Notice the helpful password strength indicator ensuring users create secure accounts.&quot;

[Enter registration details]

&quot;After completing the first step, we move on to creating a profile. Users can upload a profile picture and provide their name. This helps build trust within our community.&quot;

[Enter profile details and upload avatar]

&quot;Once registration is complete, users receive a verification code via email. Let&#39;s enter the code to verify the account.&quot;

[Enter verification code]

&quot;And just like that, our new user is registered and ready to explore The Give Hub!&quot;

CAMPAIGN DISCOVERY:
[Navigate to campaign listing]

&quot;Upon logging in, users are greeted with featured campaigns. The platform makes it easy to discover causes that align with their interests through filtering options and search functionality.&quot;

CAMPAIGN CREATION:
[Navigate to Create Campaign]

&quot;Creating a campaign is a straightforward process designed to help creators tell their story effectively. Let&#39;s start by clicking &#39;Create Campaign&#39;.&quot;

[Click Create Campaign]

&quot;The campaign creation form guides users through each necessary element. First, we&#39;ll add basic information like title, category, and funding goal.&quot;

[Fill out basic details]

&quot;Next, we can upload campaign images and videos that help bring the campaign to life.&quot;

[Upload media]

&quot;The campaign description is where creators can tell their compelling story and explain how funds will be used.&quot;

[Add description]

&quot;Finally, we set the campaign duration and review all information before submission.&quot;

[Submit campaign]

&quot;Once submitted, the campaign enters a review queue. Creators receive a confirmation and can track their campaign status from their dashboard.&quot;

DONOR EXPERIENCE:
[Navigate to a campaign]

&quot;Now let&#39;s look at the donor experience. After finding a campaign they&#39;re passionate about, potential donors can easily contribute by clicking the &#39;Donate&#39; button.&quot;

[Click Donate]

&quot;The donation process is streamlined and secure. Donors select their contribution amount and can choose between one-time or recurring support.&quot;

&quot;Users can also manage their account settings, communication preferences, and payment methods from this central location.&quot;

ADMIN LOGIN:

&quot;Now let&#39;s switch to the administrative side of The Give Hub. Platform administrators have a separate secure portal where they can monitor and manage all platform activities.&quot;

[Login to admin panel]

&quot;Upon login, administrators see a comprehensive dashboard with key platform metrics and alerts requiring attention.&quot;

CAMPAIGN REVIEW:
[Navigate to campaign review]

&quot;The campaign review section is where administrators ensure all content meets platform guidelines before going live. Here we can see campaigns awaiting review, sorted by submission date.&quot;

[Show pending campaigns]

&quot;Let&#39;s review this campaign submission. Administrators have tools to thoroughly examine all campaign elements including text content, images, funding goals, and creator information.&quot;

[Review campaign details]

&quot;For campaigns that meet our guidelines, administrators can approve them with a single click, immediately making them visible to the public.&quot;

[Approve campaign]

&quot;If a campaign requires changes, administrators can provide specific feedback to the creator, explaining exactly what needs to be modified before approval.&quot;

[Reject campaign with feedback]

USER MANAGEMENT:
[Navigate to user management]

&quot;The user management section gives administrators visibility and control over all platform users. The interface allows filtering by various criteria such as status, role, or activity level.&quot;

[Show user listing and filters]

&quot;Clicking on a user provides detailed information including their account details, campaign history, and platform activity.&quot;

[View user details]

&quot;Administrators have tools to help users, such as password reset functionality, or to take action when necessary, such as suspending accounts that violate platform guidelines.&quot;
