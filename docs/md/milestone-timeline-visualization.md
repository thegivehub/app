# Milestone Timeline Visualization

Campaign pages now include a visual timeline of milestones.

## Viewing the Timeline

Open any campaign detail page and scroll to the **Milestones** card. Below the standard list of milestones, you'll see a vertical timeline with each milestone plotted in order.

- The timeline shows the milestone title, scheduled date (if provided) and description.
- A colored status badge indicates whether the milestone is `pending`, `active`, or `completed`.
- The vertical line helps donors quickly understand upcoming and completed steps.

This feature helps convey progress at a glance and improves transparency for donors.
