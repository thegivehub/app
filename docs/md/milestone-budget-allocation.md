# Milestone Budget Allocation

Each milestone in a campaign can be assigned a budget amount. When editing a campaign, open the **Milestones** section and click **Add Milestone**. Provide the title, description, status, optional scheduled date, and the budget amount required for that milestone.

The campaign editor validates that the sum of all milestone budgets does not exceed the overall campaign goal. If the total budget is greater than the goal, saving the campaign will show an error notification.

Budgets help project managers plan spending and communicate funding needs to donors.
